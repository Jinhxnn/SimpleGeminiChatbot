# Simple_Gemini_ChatBot
Based on the information from [https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/llms/build-conversational-apps], I created a basic LLM chatbot. I modified the code by adding a sidebar with a 'Clear and Restart Chat' button to clear the chat. I intend to add more buttons, such as one that changes the theme between light and dark modes.
